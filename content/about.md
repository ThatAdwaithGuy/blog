# About Me

Hi, I'm Adwaith Kuchana, a software developer passionate about clean code, minimalism, and continuous learning.

## What I Do

I'm a developer who believes in the beauty of simple, elegant solutions. My interests include:

- **Backend Development**: Building robust and scalable systems
- **System Administration**: Managing servers and infrastructure
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and maintaining open source projects
- **Writing**: Sharing knowledge through blog posts and documentation

## My Philosophy

I believe that the best code is often the simplest code. Complexity should only be introduced when it's absolutely necessary, and even then, it should be well-documented and easy to understand.

## Tech Stack

Some of the technologies I work with:

- **Languages**: Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust
- **Tools**: Vim, Linux, Docker, Git
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, Self-hosted solutions

## Contact

While I have an email listed in the footer, I'm notoriously bad at checking it regularly. The best way to reach me is probably through GitHub or by leaving a comment on one of my posts.

## This Blog

This blog is built with Hugo and hosted with extreme minimalism in mind. No tracking, no ads, no unnecessary JavaScript - just content and a clean reading experience.

The source code for this blog is available on my GitHub if you're curious about the implementation.
